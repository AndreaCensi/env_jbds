## Introduction

After a few years of experience I realized that the best way 
to disseminate the computational elements of research 
are to disseminate them as a virtual machine. Currently, Amazon EC2
is the best platform for the job.

These are instructions that allow to clone our virtual machine setup
on your own Amazon EC2 account.

(**to finish**)

## Instructions

1. Import and activate the Amazon EC2 virtual machine on your account.
2. [Run the code](1307-ws-jbds.README.md).
